When a breakdown occurs, the user can report the issue through the RoadRescue app. The app automatically captures the user’s live GPS location and sends it to the nearest available mechanic. Mechanics can view the request, navigate to the user’s position, and provide necessary on-spot repair or towing services. Users can also book service vehicles such as towing trucks if needed.

RoadRescue bridges the gap between stranded drivers and trusted mechanics through a smooth, technology-driven workflow, ensuring help arrives quickly and safely.
